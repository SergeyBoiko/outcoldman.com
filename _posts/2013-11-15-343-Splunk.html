<p>Month ago I started to work in Splunk. I joined small team in Seattle, which is working on Developer Frameworks for Splunk. If you've never seen Splunk before I highly recommend you to do this right now. Just try to install it <a href="http://www.splunk.com/download">Splunk</a>, download one of the most powerful applications: <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/272/">Splunk App for Microsoft Windows</a> or <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/273/">Splunk App for Unix and Linux</a> and just take a look what Splunk can do for you. Installation process is very simple, bu if you need Manual go here <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Whatsinthismanual">Installation Manual</a>. If you are Minecraft fun (I don't understand this game, and don't understand why people say that this is a game) check <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/1618/">Minecraft</a> application for Splunk. </p>
<p>I highly suggest you to try all these, I promise that you will like it. I know that you will like it, because I was so impressed by this product first time I've seen it, and today I'm impressed more, because last month I spent on learning a lot of things around Splunk and I learned how to build applications for Splunk. It is so easy, check my blog post on Splunk Blogs <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/11/14/my-experience-of-building-splunk-application/">My experience of building Splunk application</a>. And let me know what you think.</p>
