<p>How many shortcut keys you know in Visual Studio? Do you want to know all of them? I know how you can learn them very easy. 
</p><p>I'd like to introduce you a cool extension for Visual Studio 2010/2012 which I wrote with help of my colleagues Drake Campbell and <a href="https://twitter.com/Mandaleeka">Aditya Mandaleeka</a>. Let me just copy-paste description from <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/83f59659-abc1-4bfa-9779-42f687af0481">Visual Studio Gallery</a>:</p>
<p>IntelliCommand - an extension for Visual Studio 2010 and 2012 which helps to find the short keys. It shows the help windows with all possible combinations when you press Ctrl or Shift or Alt or their combinations (hold it for about 2 seconds to see this window). Also it shows the list of possible combination when you press first combination of chord shortcut keys, like Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C (this combination comments selected text in editor).
</p><h2>Couple screenshots:
</h2><p>IntelliCommand shows all available shortcut keys for combination of Control + Shift after couple seconds:

	</p><p>Ctrl+K was pressed. Visual Studio waits for second combination:
