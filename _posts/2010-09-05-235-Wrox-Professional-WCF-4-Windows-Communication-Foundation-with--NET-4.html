This book has not a lot of pages, just about 400. Really, I don’t remember when I saw so thin book about some technology. But maybe this book has not a lot pages, but a lot of interesting themes.</p>  <p>First chapter is patterns and principles of SOA applications. This is the best chapter in this book. When I was reading this chapter I saw that authors have a lot experience of creating applications with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service-oriented architecture</a>. Authors described all possible architecture principles, with which you can create SOA applications. And they did not limit themselves to the principles that are possible with WCF. I think that this chapter is “must read” for all developers, it is doesn’t matter what technologies you are using: php, java or .net. And this is good luck that Wrox published this chapter online: <a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/41/04705631/0470563141.pdf">Design Principles and Patterns</a>. It is about 30 pages, so read it right now. </p>    <p>What else you will meet in this book? You will find a little knowledge about WCF-base. So if you a junior WCF-developer, when you finish read this book go to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730846.aspx">MSDN articles about WCF</a> to know more about fundamentals of WCF. You can read this book for taste WCF technology, but it is not a copy-past from MSDN. This is why you will not find all principles for example of using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.datacontractattribute.aspx">DataContractAttribute</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.datamemberattribute.aspx">DataMembetAttribute</a> attributes in this book. So what you will find in this book? There are a lot of themes, from which you can start to comprehend new technologies. This is why I like books like this, a lot of new knowledge, but you should to do a home work too if you want to be an expert in this trend. So you will know about fundamentals of integration Windows Foundation 4 and WCF, you will know how to create SOA-applications for Windows Azure AppFabric Platform, very well covered topics of authentication and security. Separate chapter is dedicated to Federated Security, I had never created applications with Federated Security, but now I’m ready. List of chapters you can find there <a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/41/04705631/0470563141-2.pdf">Contents</a>.</p>  <p>In the last three chapters authors cover three big examples. The first example, after such a flow of information, it seems so simple, and, frankly, the first thoughts that pop up, why is that? It is so simple. But this chapter (11) would be a good gift for beginners in WCF.</p>  <p>I can’t say that book is 100% the best choice. It has minuses too, the main defect of this book – is a horrible formatted code in some examples. I think it is problems of redaction: sometimes closing brackets not on necessary place, sometimes they disappear. But of course you can download source code from <a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-WCF-4-Windows-Communication-Foundation-with-NET-4.productCd-0470563141,descCd-DOWNLOAD.html">official book page</a>.</p>  <p>After reading the book I decided not to waste this knowledge into an empty and go to the exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-513">Exam 70-513: TS: Windows Communication Foundation Development with Microsoft. NET Framework 4</a>. I hadn’t so much experience of development SOA applications with WCF, just about a year, even, perhaps, less. But this book as a basis of knowledge and a bit of MSDN articles have given me enough information to pull up my knowledge and pass this exam.
